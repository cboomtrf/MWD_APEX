# MWD_APEX
MetalWeaves Designs is a craft shop inventory and transactions backoffice administration webapplication. 
The application was created for MetalWeaves Designs, a small chain maille craft company.

It is an Oracle APEX 18 application built on an Oracle 11g XE database, intended to have both a BackOffice and a FrontOffice.
In the first version of the application, we do not yet have a FrontOffice nor a dashboard.

Created as a living project dependent on the MWD_OracleDB project (https://github.com/cboomtrf/MWD_OracleDB), expect a newer version of both of these regulary with more functionality and optimized code architecture.
